# DWH
Simple (but working) WEP/WPA/WPA2 Hacking script

The tool is semi-automatic, so you have to give him the input and explicit your preferences and it will do the rest.
There are different ways to crack the password, and all of them concern external tools.

External tools involved:

- Aircrack-ng (full pack)
- John The Ripper
- Hashcat Ocl (based on Hashcat Ocl 0.49, read the comment inside the source code)
- Pyrit
- Crunch

and it is necessary the unix terminal emulator "xterm".

If you use an operating system aimed to computer security, like Kali linux or BugTraq, then you will find almost all of them, probably execpt for Hascat.
